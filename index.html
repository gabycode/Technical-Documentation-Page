            <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and
                timbre.[1][2] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
                music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated
                concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of
                timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
            <p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the
                creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the
                history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined
                music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[5] early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s[6] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.</code>

            <p>There are many types of music,including:
            <ul>
                <li> popular music</li>
                <li>traditional music</li>
                <li>art music</li>
                <li>music written for religious ceremonies</li>
                <li>work songs such as chanteys</li>

            <p>The word 'music' is derived from Ancient Greek μουσική (mousiké) '(art) of the Muses'.[3] In Greek mythology, the
                nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the
                knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture.</p>
            <p>According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term music is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French
                musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica 'the art of music', also including poetry (also [the] source of
                Spanish música, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)."</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne) '(art) of the Muses,' from fem. of mousikos 'pertaining to the Muses', from Mousa 'Muse' (see muse (n.)).</code>

            <p>Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial
                purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music
                scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their
                favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano.</p>
            <p>Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere.
                Professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in
                marching bands, concert bands and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras,
                broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in popular music forms such as rock, where illegally taped live concerts are prized by music lovers. In the jam band scene, live, improvised jam sessions are preferred to studio recordings.</code>
