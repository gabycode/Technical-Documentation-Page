        <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and
            timbre.[1][2] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
            music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated
            concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of
            timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
        <p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the
            creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the
            history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined
            music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. </p>

            <code>Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[5] early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s[6] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.</code>
