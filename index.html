            <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and
                timbre.[1][2] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
                music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated
                concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of
                timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
            <p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the
                creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the
                history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined
                music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[5] early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s[6] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.</code>
            </div>
            <p>There are many types of music,including:
            <ul>
                <li> popular music</li>
                <li>traditional music</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="etymology">
            <header>Etymology</header>
            <p>The word 'music' is derived from Ancient Greek μουσική (mousiké) '(art) of the Muses'.[3] In Greek mythology, the
                nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the
                knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture.</p>
            <p>According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term music is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French
                musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica 'the art of music', also including poetry (also [the] source of
                Spanish música, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)."</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne) '(art) of the Muses,' from fem. of mousikos 'pertaining to the Muses', from Mousa 'Muse' (see muse (n.)).</code>

            <header>Art & Entertainment</header>
            <p>Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial
                purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music
                scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their
                favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano.</p>
            <p>Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere.
                Professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in
                marching bands, concert bands and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras,
                broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in popular music forms such as rock, where illegally taped live concerts are prized by music lovers. In the jam band scene, live, improvised jam sessions are preferred to studio recordings.</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="composition">
            <header>Composition</header>
            <p>"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an instrumental music piece, a work with both singing
                and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of
                composing also includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score", which is then performed
                by the composer or by other singers or musicians.</p>
            <p>In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve
                the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord
                progression. In classical music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own compositions, but in musical
                theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="notation">
            <header>Notation</header>
            <p>In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using
                symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are
                notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music</p>
            <p>Written notation varies with the style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as sheet
                music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an image on a computer screen. In ancient
                times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or
                instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the
                performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music.</code>

            <header>Improvisation</header>
            <p>Musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic
                framework or chord progression. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with
                each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones nor from the typical
                scales associated with a chord. </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="theory">
            <header>Theory</header>
            <p>Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern
                composers' techniques and examining the language and notation of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills
                and analyzes the parameters or elements of music – rhythm, harmony (harmonic function), melody, structure, form,
                and texture. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.</p>

            <p>Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can
                include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or
                color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure.</p>

            <p>In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.[15][16]
                The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a
                musician, Recent writers such as Espie Estrella seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar
                manner.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="perceptual">
            <header>Perceptual</header>
            <p>Since the emergence of the study of psychoacoustics in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related
                more to how we hear music than how we learn to play it or study it.</p>
            <p>A slightly different way of approaching the identification of the elements of music, is to identify the "elements
                of sound" as: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location,[21] and then to define the
                "elements of music" as: sound, structure, and artistic intent.</p>
